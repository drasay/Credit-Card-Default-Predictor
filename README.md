# Credit-Card-Default-Predictor
This project implements a predictive pipeline to identify credit card defaults using the CC Default dataset. It benchmarks classical ML (XGBoost, Random Forest) against deep learning architectures (LSTM, Transformer) built in PyTorch. The repository features robust EDA, automated sequence preprocessing, and stratified K-fold cross-validation.
